# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

A basic study guide for html, css, and javascript. Creating the study guide acted as a means of learning and practicing the languages covered in the study guide.
Taking an in-depth look at the script used to make the study guide should help me understand and familiarize myself with various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions
In it, I learned how to use HTML and CSS for the first time, as well as brush up on some very old lessons in JavaScript. While admittedly fumbling with this aspect the most, I'm starting to get the hang of GitHub features

# Installation

The application cannot be installed but accessed via the html hyperlink

## Usage

Review the notes on the page but most importantly, review the script used to create it. The webpage console is also equipped with a randomizer if you have trouble deciding what coding language to study
